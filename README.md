# Sunrise Animation

## Overview

"Sunrise Animation" is a web-based graphical representation that simulates a realistic sunrise transition. This project uses WebGL to create a visually appealing animation of the sun rising, incorporating features such as delayed start, fade-in effects, vertical ascent, and dynamic color transitions to mimic dawn.

## Features

- **Delayed Start:** The animation does not start immediately, simulating the actual waiting period during dawn.
- **Fade-In Effects:** The sunrise gradually brightens, reflecting the natural increase in light at dawn.
- **Vertical Ascent:** The sun visually ascends over the horizon, enhancing the realism of the sunrise.
- **Color Transitions:** The background dynamically changes colors from dark hues of night to the warm tones of sunrise and into the brighter blues of morning.
